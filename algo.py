    Calculate relevance scores for chunks based on their distances.

    This function takes a dictionary of chunk distances, computes the relevance
    score for each chunk, and ranks the chunks based on their scores and tie-breaking rules.

        chunk_distances (dict):
            A dictionary where:
            - Keys are chunk numbers (int).
            - Values are lists of distances (float) associated with that chunk.

            A sorted list of tuples, where each tuple contains:
            - chunk_num (int): The chunk number.
            - score (float): The calculated relevance score (higher is better).
            - avg_distance (float): The average distance for the chunk.
            - min_distance (float): The minimum distance in the chunk (used for tie-breaking).

            The list is sorted in descending order by score.
